[![Build](https://github.com/gqrx-sdr/gqrx/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gqrx-sdr/gqrx/actions?query=workflow%3ABuild+branch%3Amaster)

Gqrx is an open source software defined radio (SDR) receiver implemented using [GNU Radio](https://gnuradio.org) and the [Qt GUI toolkit](https://www.qt.io/).
Currently it works on Linux and Mac with hardware supported by gr-osmosdr, including Funcube Dongle, RTL-SDR, Airspy, HackRF, BladeRF, RFSpace, USRP and SoapySDR.

Gqrx can operate as an AM/FM/SSB receiver with audio output or as an FFT-only instrument. There are also various hooks for interacting with external
applications using network sockets.

Download
========

Gqrx is distributed as a source code package and binaries for Linux and Mac. Many Linux distributions provide gqrx in their package repositories.

* [Official releases](https://github.com/gqrx-sdr/gqrx/releases)
* [Pre-release builds](https://github.com/gqrx-sdr/gqrx/actions?query=workflow%3ABuild+branch%3Amaster)

Alternate Mac support is available through [MacPorts](https://ports.macports.org/port/gqrx/summary) and [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/gqrx).

Installation 
============

Our installation instructions cover Linux, Mac OS, Raspberry-Pi, and source code. If you're installation option is not available here, you can request it via [this 1 question poll](https://poll.fm/11102781).

Linux distributions
-------------------

The simplest installation for Linux distributions is by our [official AppImage release](https://github.com/gqrx-sdr/gqrx/releases). Many Linux distributions provide gqrx in their package repositories. Linux distribution versions can be out-of-date. 

Alternatively you can install from [source code](https://github.com/gqrx-sdr/gqrx/edit/master/README.md#installation-from-source). It will soon be possible to install gqrx on [linux-64, linux-aarch64 via the conda-forge](https://github.com/gqrx-sdr/gqrx/edit/master/README.md#installation-via-conda).

Mac OS install 
--------------

The simplest installation is by our [offical Mac OS release](https://github.com/gqrx-sdr/gqrx/releases).

Alternate Mac support is available through [MacPorts](https://ports.macports.org/port/gqrx/details/) and [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/gqrx). It will soon be possible to install gqrx on [Mac OS osx-64 via the conda-forge](https://github.com/gqrx-sdr/gqrx/edit/master/README.md#installation-via-conda).

Raspberry-Pi
------------

The simplest installation for Raspberry-Pi devices is via the Raspberry-Pi software repository.

```
open the Applications menu
select Preferences
Add / Remove Software
search for Gqrx
After installation, Gqrx will be available in the Internet section of the Applications menu
```

Alternatively you can install it via [source using the instructions found on this blogpost](https://gqrx.dk/download/gqrx-sdr-for-the-raspberry-pi).

Windows
-------

Right now there is no simple way to install gqrx on Windows. It will soon be possible to install it on [Windows 64 bit (win-64) via the conda-forge](https://github.com/gqrx-sdr/gqrx/edit/master/README.md#installation-via-conda).

Installation via Conda
----------------------

(Note: Installation via Conda is not yet fully supported. It is hoped this will be possible very soon.)

The objective is to make it possible to install gqrx using [the conda-forge package manager](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/gqrx). When this happens it'll be possible to install gqrx on linux-64, linux-aarch64, osx-64, and win-64.

Installation from source code
-----------------------------

The source code is hosted on Github: https://github.com/gqrx-sdr/gqrx

To compile gqrx from source you need the following dependencies:
- GNU Radio 3.8, 3.9, or 3.10 with the following components:
    - gnuradio-runtime
    - gnuradio-analog
    - gnuradio-audio
    - gnuradio-blocks
    - gnuradio-digital
    - gnuradio-fft
    - gnuradio-filter
    - gnuradio-network (GNU Radio 3.10 only)
    - gnuradio-pmt
- The gr-iqbalance library (optional)
- Drivers for the hardware you want to have support for:
    - Funcube Dongle Pro driver via gr-fcd
    - UHD driver via gr-uhd
    - Funcube Dongle Pro+ driver from https://github.com/dl1ksv/gr-fcdproplus
    - RTL-SDR driver from https://gitea.osmocom.org/sdr/rtl-sdr
    - HackRF driver from https://github.com/mossmann/hackrf
    - Airspy driver from https://github.com/airspy/airspyone_host
    - SoapySDR from https://github.com/pothosware/SoapySDR
    - RFSpace driver is built in
- gnuradio-osmosdr from https://gitea.osmocom.org/sdr/gr-osmosdr
- pulseaudio or portaudio (Linux-only and optional)
- Qt 5 or Qt 6 with the following components:
    - Core
    - GUI
    - Network
    - Widgets
    - Svg (runtime-only)
- cmake version >= 3.2.0

Gqrx can be compiled from within Qt Creator or in a terminal:

For command line builds:
<pre>
$ git clone https://github.com/gqrx-sdr/gqrx.git gqrx.git
$ cd gqrx.git
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
</pre>
On some systems, the default cmake release builds are "over-optimized" and
perform poorly. In that case try forcing -O2 using
<pre>
export CXXFLAGS=-O2
</pre>
before the cmake step.

For Qt Creator builds:
<pre>
$ git clone https://github.com/gqrx-sdr/gqrx.git gqrx.git
$ cd gqrx.git
$ mkdir build
Start Qt Creator
Open gqrx.git/CMakeLists.txt file
At the dialog asking for build location, select gqrx.git/build
click continue
If asked to choose cmake executable, do so
click continue
click the run cmake button
click done
optionally, on the Projects page, under Build Steps/Make/Additional arguments,
	enter -j4 (replacing 4 with the number of cores in your CPU).
Use Qt Creator as before
</pre>


Usage
=====

First use - optimise
--------------------

It is strongly recommended to run the `volk_profile` utility before
running gqrx. This will detect and enable processor-specific optimisations and
will in many cases give a significant performance boost.

The first time you start gqrx it will open a device configuration dialog.
Supported devices that are connected to the computer are discovered
automatically and you can select any of them in the drop-down list.

If you don't see your device listed in the drop-down list it could be because:
- The driver has not been included in a binary distribution
- The udev rule has not been properly configured
- Linux kernel driver is blocking access to the device

You can test your device using device specific tools, such as rtl_test,
airspy_rx, hackrf_transfer, qthid, etc.

Gqrx supports multiple configurations and sessions if you have several devices
or if you want to use the same device under different configurations. You can
load a configuration from the GUI or using the `-c` command line argument. See
`gqrx --help` for a complete list of command line arguments.

Debugging
---------

Debug logging can be enabled by setting the `QT_LOGGING_RULES` environment
variable:

```
QT_LOGGING_RULES="*.debug=true;plotter.debug=false;qt.*.debug=false" gqrx
