Gqrx but with some changes which I really need.

Tested on Pi Zero 2W + 4.3" display.

Changes:
- moving the XAxis also on upper part of waterfall
- centering button on main screen (really needed on small screen)
- fullscreen button on main screen
- start DSP on startup
- TODO: pinch zoom on touch display
