Remote control protocol.

Note:   Gqrx is not a 'rig' in the sense that it is not
        supported by hamlib as a rig file, but some commands exist
        here for compatibility with some programs to pretend
        that Gqrx is a 'rig', for limited Gqrx control.
        Custom commands will just need to be sent over the local
        TCP socket.

Supported commands:
 f
    Get the frequency [Hz] of the audio demodulator.
    This is relative to the LNB LO offset, and not the
    frequency the reciever is actually tuned to.
 F <frequency>
    Set frequency [Hz] of the audio demodulator.
    This is relative to the LNB LO offset, and not the
    frequency the reciever is actually tuned to.
 m
    Get demodulator mode and passband
 M <mode> [passband]
    Set demodulator mode and passband [Hz]
    Passing a '?' as the first argument instead of 'mode' will return
    a space separated list of radio backend supported modes.
    Current supported modes:
    OFF RAW AM AMS LSB USB CWL CWR CWU CW FM WFM WFM_ST WFM_ST_OIRT
 l|L ?
    Get a space separated list of settings available for reading (l) or writing (L).
 l STRENGTH
    Get signal strength [dBFS]
 l SQL
    Get squelch threshold [dBFS]
 L SQL <sql>
    Set squelch threshold to <sql> [dBFS]
 l AF
    Get audio gain [dB]
 L AF <gain>
    Set audio gain to <gain> [dB]
 l <gain_name>_GAIN
    Get the value of the gain setting with the name <gain_name>
 L <gain_name>_GAIN <value>
    Set the value of the gain setting with the name <gain_name> to <value>
 p RDS_PI
    Get the RDS PI code (in hexadecimal). Returns 0000 if not applicable.
 p RDS_PS_NAME
    Get the RDS Program Service (PS) name
 p RDS_RADIOTEXT
    Get the RDS RadioText message
 u RECORD
    Get status of audio recorder
 U RECORD <status>
    Set status of audio recorder to <status>
 u IQRECORD
    Get status of IQ recorder
 U IQRECORD <status>
    Set status of IQ recorder to <status>
 u DSP
    Get DSP (SDR receiver) status
 U DSP <status>
    Set DSP (SDR receiver) status to <status>
 u RDS
    Get RDS decoder status.  Only functions in WFM mode.
 U RDS <status>
    Set RDS decoder to <status>.  Only functions in WFM mode.
 u MUTE
    Get audio mute status
 U MUTE <status>
    Set audio mute to <status>
 q|Q
    Close connection
 AOS
    Acquisition of signal (AOS) event, start audio recording
 LOS
    Loss of signal (LOS) event, stop audio recording
 LNB_LO [frequency]
    If frequency [Hz] is specified set the LNB LO frequency used for
    display. Otherwise print the current LNB LO frequency [Hz].
 \chk_vfo
    Get VFO option status (only usable for hamlib compatibility)
 \dump_state
    Dump state (only usable for hamlib compatibility)
 \get_powerstat
    Get power status (only usable for hamlib compatibility)
 v
    Get 'VFO' (only usable for hamlib compatibility)
 V
    Set 'VFO' (only usable for hamlib compatibility)
 s
    Get 'Split' mode (only usable for hamlib compatibility)
 S
    Set 'Split' mode (only usable for hamlib compatibility)
 _
    Get version

 gqrx_get_hw_freq
  This returns the actual hardware frequency the SDR is tuned to in Hz.
 gqrx_set_hw_freq <Hz>
  This sets the hardware frequency the SDR is tuned to.
 gqrx_get_filter_offset
  This gets the difference between the hardware frequency and the demodulator.
 gqrx_set_filter_offset [Hz]
  This sets the filter offset, useful for making deterministic hardware frequency changes.
