.SH NAME
gqrx \- Software Defined Radio GUI application
.SH DESCRIPTION
Gqrx is a software defined radio (SDR) receiver implemented using GNU Radio and
the Qt GUI toolkit. It works with hardware supported by gr-osmosdr, including
Funcube Dongle, RTL-SDR, Airspy, HackRF, BladeRF, RFSpace, USRP and SoapySDR.
.PP
Gqrx can operate as an AM/FM/SSB receiver with audio output or as an FFT-only
instrument. There are also various hooks for interacting with external
applications using network sockets.
.PP
It is strongly recommended to run the volk_profile utility before
running gqrx. This will detect and enable processor-specific optimisations and
will in many cases give a significant performance boost.
.PP
The first time you start gqrx it will open a device configuration dialog.
Supported devices that are connected to the computer are discovered
automatically and you can select any of them in the drop-down list.
.PP
If you don't see your device listed in the drop-down list it could be because:
.IP \[bu]
The driver has not been included in a binary distribution
.IP \[bu]
The udev rule has not been properly configured
.IP \[bu]
Linux kernel driver is blocking access to the device
.PP
You can test your device using device specific tools, such as rtl_test,
airspy_rx, hackrf_transfer, qthid, etc.
.PP
Gqrx supports multiple configurations and sessions if you have several devices
or if you want to use the same device under different configurations. You can
load a configuration from the GUI or using the -c command line argument.
